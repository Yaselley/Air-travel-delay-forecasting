### Air Travel Delay Forecasting
### EURECOM Challenge 1 

During this challenge, we are going to predict the arrival delay of each airplane. We are given 2 data sets: train and
test. Each data set contains many features that we will explore, try to find eventual correlations between them and
select the most useful ones to predict the house price. Finally, we will test and compare a few models trained on this
data in order to select the model with the best performance.
